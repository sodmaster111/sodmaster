# v0.1.0 (Draft)

## Summary
- First public readiness cut that bundles health probes, operational diagnostics, and asynchronous CGO/A2A job execution.
- Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/metrics` and operational self-tests at `/ops/selftest` for quick verification post-deploy.
- Includes the production `start_web.sh` bootstrap script and automated external probe workflow to validate live environments end-to-end.

## Highlights
- `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/version` endpoints for platform checks.
- Background CGO marketing campaign jobs with retries, idempotency, and a Redis-backed store.
- `/ops/selftest` endpoint with job store visibility for rapid debugging.
- GitHub Actions external probe workflow to monitor live deployments.
- Prometheus metrics with background execution timings plus webhook alerts for latency and failures.
- A2A gateway for downstream asynchronous integrations.

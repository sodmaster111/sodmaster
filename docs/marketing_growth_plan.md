## Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

- KPI Targets:
  - Followers: 500 → 950
  - Site traffic: 1,200 → 2,100 sessions
  - Conversion rate: 3.0% → 3.3%
- Key initiatives: publish automation narrative, release content matrix, introduce first creative system templates.

## Phase 2 — Acceleration (Weeks 5-8)

## Phase 3 — Scale (Weeks 9-12)

## Reporting Cadence
- Weekly: run `orchestrate_weekly_cycle`, persist report JSON, and review AnalystAI recommendations.
- Monthly: roll up cumulative metrics, track `marketing_posts_total` vs. `marketing_clicks_total`, and adjust CTA focus.
- Quarterly: compare roadmap KPIs against actual conversion rate and publish findings via `/api/v1/marketing/insights`.

The roadmap ensures marketing remains autonomous yet measurable, giving leadership confidence in channel velocity and compounding growth.
